# BLS12-381 Curve Signature

This repo contains Dusk Network's [implementation](/rust/bls12_381-sign) of the BLS Signatures using the BLS12-381 curve. This implementation currently only supports rogue-key attack resistant batching, and does not support distinct message verification.

## Rust

The [library](/rust/bls12_381-sign) is written in rust.

We also provide a sample IPC [micro-service](/rust/grpc-server) that provides a synchronous gRPC interface to the library for third-party clients.

## Go

We provide a couple options to work with the library using Go:

1. [Using CGo](/go/cgo/bls) to build and link directly to the lib binaries.
1. [Using gRPC](/go/grpc/bls) to communicate with our simple lib IPC server.

## Benchmarks

We've found the CGo version to perform faster with `Go 1.17+`

Recent benchmarks are attached for reference:
